fluency through its general education offering, Introduction to Information Technology.<br />
IET faculty facilitate innovative learning experiences that equip students with 
the technical and problem-solving competencies required to obtain employment in 
the computer industry or continue education at a four-year institution.<br />

the faculty work diligently to create partnerships with local technology employers 
and are active participants in private and government technology initiatives to 
ensure currency in both instructional methods and curricula. The department also 
provides student support mechanisms and dynamic programs that foster retention.<br /> 
With this site, students will be able to select which courses they have taken, and 
determine which certifications they qualify for. It will also let students know 
if they are only 1 course short of a certification. If so they can take the course 
or see the department chair to inquire about a possible substitution. The IET department 
consists of Information Technology, Construction Management and Engineering Technology.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
